    equality operators(==, !=) }

there are new conversion specifiers, for examplescanf("%x") will
read and assign a hexadecimal operator, "%lx" will read a long hexadecimal int, float, double, and long double types fall into the real flaoting types category
floating constants can be written in a variety of ways, some examples of writing 57.0: 57., 57.0e0, 57EO,  5.7e1. a floating constant must contain a decimal point and/or an 
exponent. exponents must be preceded by the letter E. When reading/writing something with double value, scanf("%lf") = long double. Characters are EXTREMELY 
similar to numbers in C. #include <ctype.h> for toupper function, this converts all lower case to their respective upper case characters. Implioit conversions
happen when the compiler automatically converts a value, for exampel, integer plus float, the answer is converted to a float, since it is the least harmful
process. For diagrams on the heiracrchy refer to page 143. Casts control implicit conversions. May need refresher on casting, super useful. Remember implicit
conversions when using casting, you do not need to apply a type to both values at times. You can use typedef to turn any word into a defining term (ie. int, float).
